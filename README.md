> Tests Demonstrated:
> - ADF Test
> - Hurst Exponent
> - Variance Ratio Test
> - Half-Life of Mean Reversion


  
#### Impractical Mean-Reverting Strategy:
Mean-Reverting Strategy on non mean-reverting EUR_USD data above. Shows that trading a nonstationary price series can be profitable with a mean-reverting strategy.  
Impractical Assumptions:
 - Unlimited capital (no maximum imposed on portfolio market value)
 - No transaction costs
 - Look-ahead bias (half_life extracted from in-sample data in 'Mean Reversion and Stationarity')

_Utilizes EWA and EWC ETF historical data from NASDAQ, IGE ETF data for 3-way_
> Tests Demonstrated:
> - CADF Test
> - Johansen Test
> - 3-Way Cointegration Johansen Test
> - Backtesting a Linear Mean-Reverting Strategy on a Portfolio (best eigen)


#### Trading Pairs Comparison:  
_Utilizes USO and GLD historical data from NASDAQ_
